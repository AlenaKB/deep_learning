# Investment Analysis with Deep Learning 

## Project Objective:
Using my knowledge of machine learning and neural network model building, I created a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether or not an applicant will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup using the features collected in the provided dataset.

### Methods Used:
- Neural Networks
- Deep Learning 
- Machine Lerarning 
- Inferential Statistics 
- Predictive Modeling 

### Technologies:
- Python 3.0
- TensorFlow
- Keras 

## Project Description:
In this project I've built a machine learning model that will be able to predict the success of a venture paid by Alphabet soup. The trained model will be used to determine the future decisions of the company — only those projects likely to be a success will receive any future funding from Alphabet Soup. 
The goals were to:
- Import, analyze, clean, and preprocess a “real-world” classification dataset
- Select, design, and train a binary classification model of choice
- Optimize model training and input data to achieve desired model performance

After several attempts to increase the effectiveness of the model, the highest accuracy I've managed to achieve was 73%.
